## OVERVIEW

You will be provided a screenshot from a manga (Japanese comic). It may be written in hiragana, katakana, kanji, or a combination. Your task is to perform a series of translation steps to help an English speaker who is a beginner at learning Japanese have an easier time reading, learning & understanding Japanese through mangas.


## INSTRUCTIONS

**For the provided screenshot, perform each of the following tasks:**
1. ORIGINAL: Write the original message from the screenshot
2. KANA: Write the kana version (aka, convert the kanji into hiragana for readability)
3. ROMAJI (letters): Write the kana character + romaji character side by side (so it is easy for a beginner to learn each character)
4. ROMAJI (words): Write the romaji words
5. TRANSLATION: Write the literal English translation of each word (so the English reader can feel the "Japanese intent" behind it) and then the sentence. This keeps the word order and feeling close to the original Japanese, helping English readers get a sense of how the sentence is structured in Japanese thinking. Also, write the natural English translation based on the context (so the English reader can understand what it probably best translates to). Then, put it all together into a markdown table
6. EDITORIAL: Add in any helpful editorialization about the scene that helps the reader understand it, or learn something more about Japanese

### 6. EDITORIAL

In this scene, Goku is startled as a strange yokai appears from inside a monster. The word “yokai” (妖怪) refers to supernatural creatures in Japanese folklore, which can range from mischievous spirits to terrifying demons.

The phrase 「へんな妖怪がでた！」 captures his surprise, with へんな (henna) meaning “weird” or “strange” and でた (deta) meaning “came out” or “appeared.” This is a very typical way of expressing sudden appearances in Japanese manga and anime.

If you’re learning Japanese, this scene is great for understanding how のなかから (no naka kara, “from inside”) works to describe things emerging from within something else.
